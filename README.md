## Description

This project is a website using blazor and c# to apply the stuff that we learned from class in CSCI 3155. Since Blazor uses C#, the project will contain things like typing, variable assignment with the out parameter (lab 5 worksheet), and patternmatching. I will in the video show how it works, and go a bit in depth and explain it.
