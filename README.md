## Description

This project is a website using blazor and c# to apply the stuff that we learned from class in CSCI 3155. Since Blazor uses C#, the project will contain things like typing, variable assignment with the out parameter (lab 5 worksheet), and patternmatching. I will in the video show how it works, and go a bit in depth and explain it.
## Repository Organization

All of the files to turn in such as the script and recording are in the top directory. It also contains .sln file that can be opened in an ide, and that will open the whole project.
